{"name":"Facebook-friend-selector-dialog","body":"### Facebook friend selector dialog\r\nDisplays all your Facebook friends in a javascript dialog box and allows to select a friend and bind an action to that friend.\r\n\r\nIf user is already logged in, the index file automatically opens Facebook friend selector dialog.\r\n\r\nCurrently only selecting one friend is supported, in a future release selecting multiple friends will also be implemented.\r\n\r\nI used it to post to a friend's wall, so you can use the javascript feed dialog (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/feed/) for that and define the \"to\" property with the selected id (inside the \"function process(id)\" in index.html).\r\n\r\n![Facebook friend selector dialog](http://www.bokmann.com/images/friends.png)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nFollow me @hbokmann\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nBlog: http://www.bokmann.com\r\n\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hbokmann\r\n\r\nEmail: hans@bokmann.com","tagline":"jQuery plugin to display (via Graph API) and select Facebook friends in a dialog","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
